John Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton based on 4 simple rules

- If a live cell has less than 2 alive neighbors, it will die
- If a live cell has 2 or 3 alive neighbors, it will continue to live
- If a live cell has more than 3 live neighbors, it will die
- If a dead cell has exactly 3 live neighbors, it will come alive
