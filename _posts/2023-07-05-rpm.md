[Raven's Progressive Matrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) and the [Bongard Problems](https://www.oebp.org/welcome.php)
are each sets of puzzles which are often used to test abstract reasoning for AI. Both of them are visual puzzles that require some level of 
concept understanding to solve accurately. Though there is some criticism that these two are idealized domains on which AI systems have seen 
reasonable success (See the [ConceptARC benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07141)), nevertheless, they remain a good way to test how much of an
abstract, underlying concept a system has really been able to grasp.

Raven's Progressive Matrices(RPM) are a classic test of intelligence, even administered to humans to gauge reasoning ability. RPM questions generally
consist of shape with a missing piece and around 6 to 8 options to fill in said missing piece. While many state-of-the-art deep learning models are able
to perform well on RPM and RPM like tasks, it is not always apparent how much of the underlying concept has been understood by the model.

In this RPM question, the idea is clearly that the dark portion is moving clockwise <br/>


Bongard problems are visual similar to RPM but the objective is different. Visually, they consist of 6 images on one side of a dividing line and 6
more images on the other side. However, instead of selecting a shape from a set of options, Bongard problems require the solver to find the 'difference'
between the 2 sets of images ie: what is a relatively elegant description that touches on a core property that all images on the left share, but none on
the right possess (or vice versa).

In this Bongard problem, the shapes on the left are outlined while those on the left are filled <br/>


By taking the options out of the picture, Bongard problems can expose a critical gap in AI systems today, the excel
at the visual perception task, of 'seeing' the image but struggle on drawing a relevant concept out of it. (Interesting page dedicated to documenting
Bongard Problems as [logical predicates](https://www.oebp.org/search.php?q=TRIANGLE&meta=no))
