[Introduction to Program Synthesis](https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/SynthesisCourse/index.htm) is a course taught by Prof. Armando Solar-Lezama at MIT. It is a great introduction to the field and I have referred to this material often during my research project. It covers the 3 major paradigms of synthesizing programs

- Inductive Synthesis (Search based techniques, Sketching etc.)
- Functional Synthesis (SyGuS, CEGIS, SAT solvers)
- Probabilistic Methods (Using ML)
