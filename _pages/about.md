Work in progress!

I am Atharva Phadnis, a B.E. Computer Science graduate from [BITS-Pilani, Goa](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/) (2022). I am currently working full-time at Oracle. My research interests broadly span Artificial Intelligence, Programming Languages and [Program Synthesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_synthesis)


I am interested in techniques of generating programs from higher level specifications. My curiosity lies at the intersection os synthesis techniques and AI, interpreting functions or policies learned by AI systems as symbolic programs and examining how this interpretation could effectively leverage existing ideas from symbolic logic and formal methods. I wish to channel these ideas towards developing robust, safe, and interpretable AI systems that can perform effectively on tasks that require 'human-like' logical reasoning. Such systems could potential be the way to move beyond today's ML models which struggle with logical reasoning but are fantastic at perceptiion tasks to more generalizable systems that can reason about intrinsic, domain-specific concepts.
