Work in progress!

I am Atharva Phadnis, a B.E. Computer Science graduate from BITS-Pilani, Goa (2022). I am currently working full-time at Oracle. My research interests broadly span Program Synthesis and Artificial Intelligence. I am interested in interpreting functions or policies learned by AI systems as programs and examining how this interpretation could effectively leverage existing ideas from symbolic logic and formal methods. I wish to channel these ideas towards developing robust, safe, and interpretable AI systems that can perform effectively on tasks that require 'human-like' logical reasoning.
