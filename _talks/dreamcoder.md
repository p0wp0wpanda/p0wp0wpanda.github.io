DreamCoder is an interesting approach to program synthesis where the system gains expertise by building up a library of 'concepts' expressed in a domain-specific programming languages. It uses a 'wake-sleep' algorithm to extend the language with new symbolic abstractions by building them compositionally from those learned earlier. This helps reduce the length of the synthesized program and hence vastly increases the space of feasible programs to search from. You can find the original paper [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08381)
